It is a user friendly, easy to implement GUI for GSM IMSI catching. Any user from any research background can sniff IMSI's of users whose mobile station is using 2G.
Following a passive approach using this app is implemented using Ubuntu 14.04 and requires SDR packages including GNURadio, Kalibrate-rtl, , GR-GSM and a python script simple_IMSI-catcher.py.
It should be noted that it is only for educational purpose and not for juveline hacking.

Basically, i have used the work of ptrkrysik/gr-gsm, the pioneer in rtl-sdr IMSI catching, secondly Oros42/IMSI-catcher, whose IMSI catching script is being used.

The following app is based on the work done by the above two gentlemen. 

Any help and improvement would be highly appreciated

I would like to dedicate my work to all the hardworking researcher working for the betterment of man-kind and especially to ptrkrysik/gr-gsm and Oros42/IMSI-catcher,
for building the firm foundation on which i have just sprinkled my contribution

I wish you good health and God speed.
